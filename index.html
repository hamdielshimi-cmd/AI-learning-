  <div class="slide">
    <h2><span class="emoji">ü§ñ</span> What is AI?</h2>
    <div class="box">
      Imagine a computer that can "think" and "learn" like people do! That's Artificial Intelligence. It's like a super-smart robot brain inside a computer. AI helps computers do things like understand what you say, recognize faces in photos, or even play games! You might already be using AI without even knowing it! For example, when you ask your phone a question, or when a website suggests a video you might like, or even when you were generating games with ChatGPT, that's AI at work!

  <!-- Slide 4: Why is AI cool -->
  <div class="slide">
    <h2><span class="emoji">‚ú®</span> Why is AI cool?</h2>
    <div class="box">
      AI is super cool because it's like a magical helper for your imagination!
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> You can use AI to help you write amazing stories, draw fantastic pictures, or even compose music!</li>
        <li><strong>Problem-solving:</strong> AI can help us solve tricky puzzles and big problems, like how to make cars drive themselves safely or how to predict the weather.</li>
        <li><strong>Games:</strong> As you know, AI can help create endless virtual worlds in games like Minecraft, or make game characters smarter and more challenging. It can even beat human champions at games like Chess or Jeopardy! It's all about making things more fun and interesting!</li>

  <!-- Slide 6: Machine Learning -->
  <div class="slide">
    <h2><span class="emoji">üê£</span> What is Machine Learning?</h2>
    <div class="box">
      Machine Learning (ML) is how AI gets smart! Think of it like teaching a pet a new trick, or how you learn from experience. Just like you learn to ride a bike by practicing a lot, AI learns by looking at lots and lots of examples. It's about computers learning from data without being told every single step.
    </div>
    <button class="btn" onclick="next()">Next ‚Üí</button>
  </div>

  <!-- Slide 7: Data -->
  <div class="slide">
    <h2><span class="emoji">üìä</span> Data, Data Everywhere!</h2>
    <div class="box">
      What kind of "stuff" does AI look at? AI learns from "data," which is just information! It can be all sorts of stuff like:
      <ul>
        <li>Pictures: Like all the photos of cats and dogs on the internet!</li>
        <li>Words: Like all the books and articles ever written!</li>
        <li>Numbers: Like how many times a particular game character wins a level! The more good "stuff" (data) AI looks at, the smarter it gets!</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <button class="btn" onclick="next()">Next ‚Üí</button>
  </div>

  <!-- Slide 8: Algorithms -->
  <div class="slide">
    <h2><span class="emoji">üìú</span> AI's Secret Rules (Algorithms)</h2>
    <div class="box">
      How AI knows what to do. Algorithms are like a set of secret instructions or recipes that AI follows. If you want to bake cookies, you follow a recipe, right? AI follows algorithms to know how to sort pictures, suggest videos, or even make your game characters move around.

  <!-- Slide 9: Training & Predicting -->
  <div class="slide">
    <h2><span class="emoji">üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</span> Practice Makes Perfect (Training & Predicting)</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <strong>Training:</strong> This is when we show AI lots of data, and it "practices" learning from it. It looks for patterns and connections, just like you practice your favorite game to get better.<br/>
      <strong>Predicting:</strong> Once AI has practiced enough, it can "guess" or "predict" things about new information. For example, if it's seen lots of pictures of different plants, it might be able to predict how tall a new plant will grow.

  <!-- Slide 10: Fairness -->
  <div class="slide">
    <h2><span class="emoji">‚öñÔ∏è</span> Being Fair with AI</h2>
    <div class="box">
      Making sure AI is kind and doesn't make unfair choices. It's super important that AI is fair and kind, just like you are! Sometimes, if the data we use to teach AI isn't fair, the AI might learn to make unfair choices. So, we need to be careful and make sure AI is taught with lots of different, fair information so it doesn't accidentally do anything unkind or biased.

  <div class="slide">
    <h2><span class="emoji">üí¨</span> Chatting Smarter with AI</h2>
    <div class="box">
      You've used chatbots like ChatGPT to generate games, but let's make it even more fun!<br/>
      <strong>Fun ways to ask questions to AI chatbots:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Pretend AI is a character: "Hey, magical genie, tell me a story about a brave knight and a grumpy dragon!"</li>
        <li>Tell it what you want it to be: "You are a creative writer. Help me invent a new alien creature for my game, with special powers and a funny name."</li>
        <li>Ask it to make up stories, write poems, or create characters for games! Try asking it to write a silly poem about your pet, or create a description for a new character in your favorite video game.</li>

    <div class="box">
      Imagine telling a computer to draw anything you can dream up! That's what AI image generation does!<br/>
      <strong>How to tell AI what pictures to draw for you:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Be descriptive! Instead of "draw a dog," try "draw a fluffy golden retriever wearing sunglasses, riding a skateboard in space!"</li>
        <li>Use fun words! The more detail you give, the more amazing the picture will be. Think about colors, moods, and actions.</li>
        <li>You can even experiment with different styles like "cartoon," "photorealistic," or "painted like a masterpiece".</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="box">
      <strong>Image Creation Contest:</strong> Pick a fun theme (like "Underwater Robot Kingdom" or "Magical Forest Animals") and challenge yourself to create the most imaginative image using an AI image generator (like DALL-E or Midjourney if you have access, or even a simpler online tool).<br/><br/>
      <strong>"Improve this Prompt" Game:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>For a chatbot: Take a simple prompt like "Write a story." How can you make it better and more fun? (e.g., "Write a funny adventure story about a squirrel who becomes a superhero, set in a giant treehouse!")</li>
        <li>For an image generator: How can you make "Draw a car" into something super creative? (e.g., "Draw a futuristic flying car made of shiny chrome, zooming through a city of neon lights at night, in a cyberpunk style!")</li>
      </ul>
